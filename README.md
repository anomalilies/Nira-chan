# Nira-chan

A Discord bot for ZUTOMAYO ZONE!

## Commands and Capabilities

Although Nira has been designed with ZUTOMAYO ZONE in mind, recent developments have led to the bot beginning to be able to perform general purpose tasks globally.
- Most notably, when inviting Nira to other servers, and you'll be able to use external emotes from them via `<prefix>emotename` or `:emotename:`!
- Non-Nitro users will be also able to use animated emotes this way.

## Config File

Developers will need to create a config file specific to their test server.
If you need to update the config in any way, make sure the properties are the same for every other config file/backup.

1. Copy `config.json`.
2. Rename the copy to something else temporarily, e.g.: `prod.json`.
3. Customise `config.json` to your test server.
4. Start developing!

Notes:

- Do NOT commit your custom `config.json` file!
- If you've messed up, you should still have `prod.json`.
- If you've REALLY messed up, copy `config_backup.json` and start over from scratch.
