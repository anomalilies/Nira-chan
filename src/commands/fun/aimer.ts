Her music is not just music. Her songs are not just songs. Her voice is not just a voice. They are special. She’s my escapism, my drug, my sedative. Listening to her is one of the few ways I can relax and calm down. She never failed to calm me down. Whenever I listen to her I feel bewitched, taken, enchanted. When I listen to her, nothing matters. I cried when I watched her Budokan live. She’s just so gorgeous and cute and amazing and happy there, I just couldn’t help but cry. I listen to her daily, I feel really uncomfortable if I haven’t heard anything Aimer for a day. I’m addicted, and I love it. Yes I’m aware that this part makes no coherent sense, I don’t care, just bear with me. There is no doubt in my mind that I am her biggest fan. Doesn’t matter if someone has listened to her more than I did, or if someone knows all her lyrics word by word. I just simply know that no one feels the way I do. There is a person that understands me and supports me, and I’m happy that this person also likes Aimer. I am the biggest fan of Aimer because she has become the part of my life.',
